## Existing Problems
 
* Power imbalance 
* Invisible discrimination
* unconscious biases
 
## Interviews and Analyses

### Objectives

* talk about your experiences
* provide solutions/trials you have made
* suggest further strategies

## Organizations and Programs

* [Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](https://wimlworkshop.org/)
* [PARITY MOVEMENT](https://paritymovement.org/) (focusing on academic bullying)
* [WiML-ML4PS](WiML-ML4PS.md)

## Seeking for Better Solutions

* Diversity recruitment is not enough. Sexual harassment training is not enough.
* We need women in authority positions to speak up, to actively support junior females.
* Start from the beginning: provide equal training opportunities for female students; foster a better media environment.
* Fight unconscious biases.
* Sharing is empowering. Simply sharing experiences with colleagues or experienced professionals helps to overcome difficult situations.
